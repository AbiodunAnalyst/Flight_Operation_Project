# Flight Operation Project
Context: New York's airports serve as critical hubs for air traffic within the United States. With millions of passengers passing through each year, efficient airport operations are essential for the state's economy, tourism industry, and business activities (Reference: New York State Department of Transportation, "New York State Airport System Plan" - 2021).

 Challenges: Managing the large volume of air traffic poses significant challenges, compounded by the region's unpredictable weather patterns. Delays and cancellations are common occurrences, impacting both airlines and passengers alike.

 Analysis Goals: Our analysis aims to gain insights into various aspects of airport operations and air travel dynamics over an 11-year period, spanning from 2013 to 2023. Key objectives include understanding patterns of delays and cancellations, evaluating the performance of airports and airlines, identifying peak travel times, and assessing the impact of weather conditions on flight operations.

 Target Audience: The primary audience for this analysis includes senior management teams within airports and airlines operating in the New York region. By providing actionable insights derived from comprehensive data analysis, we aim to empower decision-makers to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and mitigate the impact of adverse weather conditions on air travel.
